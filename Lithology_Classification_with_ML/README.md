# 2020 FORCE Machine Learning Contest 

## Final Model Submission ##


####  Machine Predicted Lithology ####
Overview at [contest website](https://xeek.ai/challenges/force-well-logs/overview)

This is a repo for the recently concluded FORCE machine learning lithology prediction competition which spanned from August to October.
This is my final submission file which have a score of -0.5118 and ranking 24th on the open test leaderboard.
Extensive validations were done using different sets wells which were randomly selected. The validation contain different validation with different validation techniques. The notebooks are quite unorganized as they were only used to experiment different techniques during the competition.

Several ensemble techniques were tried but the final model which was the best on local validationn and open test LB -- was a single 10 stratified kfold xgboost model. 

FORCE_Submission_File.ipynb is the final notebook used in making predictions. Other notebooks were used earlier during the competitions for validations and trying out different techniques.
